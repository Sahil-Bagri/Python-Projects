---The functions i used 
--1st. Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable, list is changeable and indexed.
--2nd. Dictionaries are used to store data values in key and value pairs. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
--3rd. For loop is used for iterating over a sequence (it can be a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). For loop is used when we know the number of repititions.
--4th. F-string allows you to format selected parts of a string. To use a string as an f-string,simply put an f in front of the string literal, like this:(f"").
--5th. The newline character (\n) is a unique character used to represent a line break in a string or a text file
